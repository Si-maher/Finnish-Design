# Finnish Design Shop

This mini project was created using CSS and HTML with a little touch of Javascript to create the mobile navigation.
Media Queries help to make this small project responsive.

# Aim

The overall aim was to practice using CSS Grid along with Media Queries to create a working webpage with the emphasis on UI rather than functionality.
The links are not active, again purely there for UI.

# Problems

Managing the overall layout, especially concerning responsiveness still can be problematic, and creating the right type of work flow is still a work in progress!
